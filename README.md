# Canine Artistry: A Journey into Doggy Style Transfer

## 🔄 Overview:
This project will explore the exciting realm of neural style transfer. The focus will be on using the Inception network and TensorFlow to implement the style transfer technique on a dog image. With the help of this project, you will get hands-on experience on building a style transfer model that can be applied to a wide range of images.

## 🎊 Motivation:
Neural style transfer is a highly fascinating area of deep learning that has the potential to revolutionize the world of digital art. With this project, you will have the opportunity to learn how to apply this innovative technique to create unique and striking images of dogs.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Understanding the concept of neural style transfer
2)	Hands-on experience of building a style transfer model
3)	Familiarizing with the Inception network and TensorFlow

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
The project will be built using TensorFlow, a popular open-source deep learning library. The Inception network will be used to extract features from the images, and the style transfer technique will be applied to transfer the style from a style image to a content image of a dog.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use:
1)	TensorFlow
2)	Inception Network
3)	Matplotlib
4)	Numpy

## 📚 Data Source:
The project will use only two images, a content image of a dog and a style image that you want to transfer the style to.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Import required libraries and tools.
2)	Download the images.
3)	Build the feature extractor using the Inception network.
4)	Calculate the style loss and content loss.
5)	Calculate the total loss.
6)	Calculate gradients and update the image with the style.
7)	Generate the stylized image.

## 👥 Credits:
This project was made possible with the use of TensorFlow and the Inception network. The team explored the fascinating world of neural style transfer by building a model that can be applied to a variety of images. A dog image was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the style transfer technique. Thank you OpenAI for supporting this project and providing the tools necessary for this hands-on learning experience.
